# Fitness Tracking Dashboard Project

## Overview

This GitHub repository houses the comprehensive code and data for a fitness tracking dashboard project. The project's journey begins with the meticulous cleaning and merging of individual CSV files using Google Colab. This initial step ensures that the data is prepared for the subsequent exploratory data analysis (EDA), conducted both theoretically and visually.

## Exploration and Analysis

The merged datasets offer a rich source of insights, paving the way for detailed exploratory data analysis. Theoretical examinations alongside visualizations bring to light patterns, trends, and correlations within the fitness tracking data. Individual profiles for daily, hourly, and minute-based activities are generated using Panda Profiles, providing a deeper understanding of user behaviors.

## Tableau Dashboard

The pinnacle of the project is the creation of a dynamic Tableau dashboard, hosted live [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/arijit.dhali/viz/FitnessDashboard_17066249737060/HomeDashboard). This interactive dashboard encapsulates the essence of the fitness data, making it accessible and user-friendly.
